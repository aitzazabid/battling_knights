# battling_knights

## Assumptions

Python is installed in the system

## Structure

There are the following files in the main directory

1) game.py
* It contains the gameplay logic, it will read the text file (move.txt)
2) player.py
* It contains the player's complete logic
3) item.py
* It contains the item's complete logic
4) moves.txt
* It contains the information if the player's movements
5) final_state.json 
* It contains the game's final results

## How it works

we have to add the movements of the player in the moves.txt and  game.py read all the movements from the file and complete compile the final_state.json file based on the gameplay logic using the items.py file.

## How to run

1) write the moves in moves.py
2) run the game.py
